Overview:
This project explores which factors most strongly influence the price of a used car. 
Using a dataset of over 400K+ records, the analysis applies the CRISP-DM framework to clean, visualize, and model data to help a used-car dealership understand what consumers value most.

Goal: Identify what factors drive used-car prices and provide inventory/pricing guidance for a used-car dealership.


CRISP-DM Framework: 

I explored data cleaning, visualization, and modeling to help a used car dealership understand what consumers value most.

What we are trying to solve:
1) Which features most strongly influence price?
2) What factors effedct the price of car ?
   (Example:  brand, mileage, age of car, condition, transmission, fuel, Previous history of cars) 
3) How accurate are our price predictions?


Summary : 
1) As the car ages and mileage rises, the price drops.
2) Pricing variance is also influenced by fuel type, condition, and transmission.
3) SUVs and trucks, as well as premium manufacturers, have greater price retention.
4) Data-driven pricing increases dealership ROI and minimizes assumption.


Next steps: 
1) Adding the accident history and previous ownership data will help to decide on the car value
2) Price varies depending on the seasons ( Year end sales)
